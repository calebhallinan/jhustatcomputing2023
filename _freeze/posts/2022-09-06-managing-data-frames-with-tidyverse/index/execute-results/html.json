The basic structure of a data frame is that there is one observation per row and each column represents a variable, a measure, feature, or characteristic of that observation. R has an internal implementation of data frames that is likely the one you will use most often. However, there are packages on CRAN that implement data frames via things like relational databases that allow you to operate on very very large data frames (but we will not discuss them here).\n\nGiven the importance of managing data frames, it is important that we have good tools for dealing with them. For example, operations like filtering rows, re-ordering rows, and selecting columns, can often be tedious operations in R whose syntax is not very intuitive. The `dplyr` package is designed to mitigate a lot of these problems and to provide a highly optimized set of routines specifically for dealing with data frames.\n\n### Tibbles\n\nAnother type of data structure that we need to discuss is called the **tibble**! It's best to think of tibbles as an updated and stylish version of the `data.frame`. And, tibbles are what tidyverse packages work with most seamlessly. Now, that does not mean tidyverse packages *require* tibbles. In fact, they still work with `data.frames`, but the more you work with tidyverse and tidyverse-adjacent packages, the more you will see the advantages of using tibbles.\n\nBefore we go any further, tibbles *are* data frames, but they have some new bells and whistles to make your life easier.\n\n#### How tibbles differ from `data.frame`\n\nThere are a number of differences between tibbles and `data.frames`. To see a full vignette about tibbles and how they differ from data.frame, you will want to execute `vignette(\"tibble\")` and read through that vignette. However, we will summarize some of the most important points here:\n\n-   **Input type remains unchanged** - `data.frame` is notorious for treating strings as factors; this will not happen with tibbles\n-   **Variable names remain unchanged** - In base R, creating `data.frames` will remove spaces from names, converting them to periods or add \"x\" before numeric column names. Creating tibbles will not change variable (column) names.\n-   **There are no `row.names()` for a tibble** - Tidy data requires that variables be stored in a consistent way, removing the need for row names.\n-   **Tibbles print first ten rows and columns that fit on one screen** - Printing a tibble to screen will never print the entire huge data frame out. By default, it just shows what fits to your screen.\n\n#### Creating a tibble\n\nThe tibble package is part of the `tidyverse` and can thus be loaded in (once installed) using:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### `as_tibble()`\n\nSince many packages use the historical data.frame from base R, you will often find yourself in the situation that you have a data.frame and want to convert that data.frame to a tibble. To do so, the `as_tibble()` function is exactly what you are looking for.\n\nFor the example, in this lesson we will be using a dataset containing air pollution and temperature data for the city of Chicago in the U.S. The dataset is available in this repository.\n\nYou can load the data into R using the `readRDS()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(here)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nhere() starts at /Users/stephaniehicks/Documents/github/teaching/jhustatcomputing2022\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- readRDS(here(\"data\", \"chicago.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can see some basic characteristics of the dataset with the `dim()` and `str()` functions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(chicago)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6940    8\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(chicago)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n'data.frame':\t6940 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ city      : chr  \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" ...\n $ tmpd      : num  31.5 33 33 29 32 40 34.5 29 26.5 32.5 ...\n $ dptp      : num  31.5 29.9 27.4 28.6 28.9 ...\n $ date      : Date, format: \"1987-01-01\" \"1987-01-02\" ...\n $ pm25tmean2: num  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ pm10tmean2: num  34 NA 34.2 47 NA ...\n $ o3tmean2  : num  4.25 3.3 3.33 4.38 4.75 ...\n $ no2tmean2 : num  20 23.2 23.8 30.4 30.3 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see this data structure is a `data.frame` with 6940 observations and 8 variables. To convert this `data.frame` to a tibble you would use the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(as_tibble(chicago))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntibble [6,940 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ city      : chr [1:6940] \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" ...\n $ tmpd      : num [1:6940] 31.5 33 33 29 32 40 34.5 29 26.5 32.5 ...\n $ dptp      : num [1:6940] 31.5 29.9 27.4 28.6 28.9 ...\n $ date      : Date[1:6940], format: \"1987-01-01\" \"1987-01-02\" ...\n $ pm25tmean2: num [1:6940] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ pm10tmean2: num [1:6940] 34 NA 34.2 47 NA ...\n $ o3tmean2  : num [1:6940] 4.25 3.3 3.33 4.38 4.75 ...\n $ no2tmean2 : num [1:6940] 20 23.2 23.8 30.4 30.3 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote in the above example and as mentioned earlier, that tibbles, by default, only print the first ten rows to screen. If you were to print `chicago` to screen, all 6940 rows would be displayed. When working with large `data.frames`, this default behavior can be incredibly frustrating. Using tibbles removes this frustration because of the default settings for tibble printing.\n\nAdditionally, you will note that the type of the variable is printed for each variable in the tibble. This helpful feature is another added bonus of tibbles relative to `data.frame`.\n\nIf you *do* want to see more rows from the tibble, there are a few options! First, the `View()` function in RStudio is incredibly helpful. The input to this function is the data.frame or tibble you would like to see. Specifically, `View(chicago)` would provide you, the viewer, with a scrollable view (in a new tab) of the complete dataset.\n\nA second option is the fact that `print()` enables you to specify how many rows and columns you would like to display. Here, we again display the `chicago` data.frame as a tibble but specify that we'd only like to see 5 rows. The `width = Inf` argument specifies that we would like to see all the possible columns. Here, there are only 8, but for larger datasets, this can be helpful to specify.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas_tibble(chicago) %>% \n  print(n = 5, width = Inf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6,940 × 8\n  city   tmpd  dptp date       pm25tmean2 pm10tmean2 o3tmean2 no2tmean2\n  <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <date>          <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 chic   31.5  31.5 1987-01-01         NA       34       4.25      20.0\n2 chic   33    29.9 1987-01-02         NA       NA       3.30      23.2\n3 chic   33    27.4 1987-01-03         NA       34.2     3.33      23.8\n4 chic   29    28.6 1987-01-04         NA       47       4.38      30.4\n5 chic   32    28.9 1987-01-05         NA       NA       4.75      30.3\n# … with 6,935 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### `tibble()`\n\nAlternatively, you can create a tibble on the fly by using `tibble()` and specifying the information you'd like stored in each column. Note that if you provide a single value, this value will be repeated across all rows of the tibble. This is referred to as \"recycling inputs of length 1.\"\n\nIn the example here, we see that the column `c` will contain the value '1' across all rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(\n  a = 1:5,\n  b = 6:10,\n  c = 1,\n  z = (a + b)^2 + c\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n      a     b     c     z\n  <int> <int> <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1     6     1    50\n2     2     7     1    82\n3     3     8     1   122\n4     4     9     1   170\n5     5    10     1   226\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `tibble()` function allows you to quickly generate tibbles and even allows you to reference columns within the tibble you're creating, as seen in column z of the example above.\n\nWe also noted previously that tibbles can have column names that are not allowed in data.frame. In this example, we see that to utilize a nontraditional variable name, you surround the column name with backticks. Note that to refer to such columns in other tidyverse packages, you'll continue to use backticks surrounding the variable name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(\n  `two words` = 1:5,\n  `12` = \"numeric\",\n  `:)` = \"smile\",\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 3\n  `two words` `12`    `:)` \n        <int> <chr>   <chr>\n1           1 numeric smile\n2           2 numeric smile\n3           3 numeric smile\n4           4 numeric smile\n5           5 numeric smile\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Subsetting\n\nSubsetting tibbles also differs slightly from how subsetting occurs with data.frame. When it comes to tibbles, `[[` can subset by name or position; `$` only subsets by name. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- tibble(\n  a = 1:5,\n  b = 6:10,\n  c = 1,\n  z = (a + b)^2 + c\n)\n\n# Extract by name using $ or [[]]\ndf$z\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  50  82 122 170 226\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf[[\"z\"]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  50  82 122 170 226\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract by position requires [[]]\ndf[[4]]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  50  82 122 170 226\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHaving now discussed tibbles, which are the type of object most tidyverse and tidyverse-adjacent packages work best with, we now know the goal. In many cases, tibbles are ultimately what we want to work with in R. However, data are stored in many different formats outside of R. We will spend the rest of this lesson discussing wrangling functions that work either a `data.frame` or tibble.\n\n# The `dplyr` Package\n\nThe `dplyr` package was developed by RStudio and is an optimized and distilled version of the older `plyr` package for data manipulation. The `dplyr` package does not provide any \"new\" functionality to R per se, in the sense that everything `dplyr` does could already be done with base R, but it **greatly** simplifies existing functionality in R.\n\nOne important contribution of the `dplyr` package is that it provides a \"grammar\" (in particular, verbs) for data manipulation and for operating on data frames. With this grammar, you can sensibly communicate what it is that you are doing to a data frame that other people can understand (assuming they also know the grammar). This is useful because it provides an abstraction for data manipulation that previously did not exist. Another useful contribution is that the `dplyr` functions are **very** fast, as many key operations are coded in C++.\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst on the dplyr package](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/main/rstats-artwork/dplyr_wrangling.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\n\\[**Source**: [Artwork by Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)\\]\n\n### `dplyr` grammar\n\nSome of the key \"verbs\" provided by the `dplyr` package are\n\n-   `select()`: return a subset of the columns of a data frame, using a flexible notation\n\n-   `filter()`: extract a subset of rows from a data frame based on logical conditions\n\n-   `arrange()`: reorder rows of a data frame\n\n-   `rename()`: rename variables in a data frame\n\n-   `mutate()`: add new variables/columns or transform existing variables\n\n-   `summarise()` / `summarize()`: generate summary statistics of different variables in the data frame, possibly within strata\n\n-   `%>%`: the \"pipe\" operator is used to connect multiple verb actions together into a pipeline\n\nThe `dplyr` package as a number of its own data types that it takes advantage of. For example, there is a handy `print` method that prevents you from printing a lot of data to the console. Most of the time, these additional data types are transparent to the user and do not need to be worried about.\n\n### `dplyr` functions\n\nAll of the functions that we will discuss in this Chapter will have a few common characteristics. In particular,\n\n1.  The first argument is a data frame.\n\n2.  The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame specified in the first argument, and you can refer to columns in the data frame directly (without using the `$` operator, just use the column names).\n\n3.  The return result of a function is a new data frame.\n\n4.  Data frames must be properly formatted and annotated for this to all be useful. In particular, the data must be [tidy](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper). In short, there should be one observation per row, and each column should represent a feature or characteristic of that observation.\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst on tidy data](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/main/rstats-artwork/tidydata_1.jpg){width=\"80%\"}\n\n\\[**Source**: [Artwork by Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)\\]\n\n### `dplyr` installation\n\nThe `dplyr` package can be installed from CRAN or from GitHub using the `devtools` package and the `install_github()` function. The GitHub repository will usually contain the latest updates to the package and the development version.\n\nTo install from CRAN, just run\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe `dplyr` package is also installed when you install the `tidyverse` meta-package.\n\nAfter installing the package it is important that you load it into your R session with the `library()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou may get some warnings when the package is loaded because there are functions in the `dplyr` package that have the same name as functions in other packages. For now you can ignore the warnings.\n\n### `select()`\n\nWe will continue to use the `chicago` dataset containing air pollution and temperature data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- as_tibble(chicago)\nstr(chicago)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntibble [6,940 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ city      : chr [1:6940] \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" \"chic\" ...\n $ tmpd      : num [1:6940] 31.5 33 33 29 32 40 34.5 29 26.5 32.5 ...\n $ dptp      : num [1:6940] 31.5 29.9 27.4 28.6 28.9 ...\n $ date      : Date[1:6940], format: \"1987-01-01\" \"1987-01-02\" ...\n $ pm25tmean2: num [1:6940] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ pm10tmean2: num [1:6940] 34 NA 34.2 47 NA ...\n $ o3tmean2  : num [1:6940] 4.25 3.3 3.33 4.38 4.75 ...\n $ no2tmean2 : num [1:6940] 20 23.2 23.8 30.4 30.3 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `select()` function can be used to select columns of a data frame that you want to focus on. Often you will have a large data frame containing \"all\" of the data, but any *given* analysis might only use a subset of variables or observations. The `select()` function allows you to get the few columns you might need.\n\nSuppose we wanted to take the first 3 columns only. There are a few ways to do this. We could for example use numerical indices. But we can also use the names directly.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnames(chicago)[1:3]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"city\" \"tmpd\" \"dptp\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset <- select(chicago, city:dptp)\nhead(subset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  city   tmpd  dptp\n  <chr> <dbl> <dbl>\n1 chic   31.5  31.5\n2 chic   33    29.9\n3 chic   33    27.4\n4 chic   29    28.6\n5 chic   32    28.9\n6 chic   40    35.1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the `:` normally cannot be used with names or strings, but inside the `select()` function you can use it to specify a range of variable names.\n\nYou can also **omit** variables using the `select()` function by using the negative sign. With `select()` you can do\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nselect(chicago, -(city:dptp))\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhich indicates that we should include every variable *except* the variables `city` through `dptp`. The equivalent code in base R would be\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ni <- match(\"city\", names(chicago))\nj <- match(\"dptp\", names(chicago))\nhead(chicago[, -(i:j)])\n```\n:::\n\n\nNot super intuitive, right?\n\nThe `select()` function also allows a special syntax that allows you to specify variable names based on patterns. So, for example, if you wanted to keep every variable that ends with a \"2\", we could do\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset <- select(chicago, ends_with(\"2\"))\nstr(subset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntibble [6,940 × 4] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ pm25tmean2: num [1:6940] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n $ pm10tmean2: num [1:6940] 34 NA 34.2 47 NA ...\n $ o3tmean2  : num [1:6940] 4.25 3.3 3.33 4.38 4.75 ...\n $ no2tmean2 : num [1:6940] 20 23.2 23.8 30.4 30.3 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr if we wanted to keep every variable that starts with a \"d\", we could do\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsubset <- select(chicago, starts_with(\"d\"))\nstr(subset)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\ntibble [6,940 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ dptp: num [1:6940] 31.5 29.9 27.4 28.6 28.9 ...\n $ date: Date[1:6940], format: \"1987-01-01\" \"1987-01-02\" ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also use more general regular expressions if necessary. See the help page (`?select`) for more details.\n\n### `filter()`\n\nThe `filter()` function is used to extract subsets of rows from a data frame.

A common use of this is to identify observations with non-missing data (e.g., `!(is.na(pm10tmean2))`).\n\n### `arrange()`\n\nThe `arrange()` function is used to reorder rows of a data frame according to one of the variables/columns. Reordering rows of a data frame (while preserving corresponding order of other columns) is normally a pain to do in R. The `arrange()` function simplifies the process quite a bit.\n\nHere we can order the rows of the data frame by date, so that the first row is the earliest (oldest) observation and the last row is the latest (most recent) observation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- arrange(chicago, date)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can now check the first few rows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       pm25tmean2\n  <date>          <dbl>\n1 1987-01-01         NA\n2 1987-01-02         NA\n3 1987-01-03         NA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nand the last few rows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       pm25tmean2\n  <date>          <dbl>\n1 2005-12-29       7.45\n2 2005-12-30      15.1 \n3 2005-12-31      15   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nColumns can be arranged in descending order too by useing the special `desc()` operator.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- arrange(chicago, desc(date))\n```\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the first three and last three rows shows the dates in descending order.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       pm25tmean2\n  <date>          <dbl>\n1 2005-12-31      15   \n2 2005-12-30      15.1 \n3 2005-12-29       7.45\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntail(select(chicago, date, pm25tmean2), 3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  date       pm25tmean2\n  <date>          <dbl>\n1 1987-01-03         NA\n2 1987-01-02         NA\n3 1987-01-01         NA\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### `rename()`\n\nRenaming a variable in a data frame in R is surprisingly hard to do!

Often, you want to create new variables that are derived from existing variables and `mutate()` provides a clean interface for doing that.\n\n![Artwork by Allison Horst on mutate() function](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/raw/main/rstats-artwork/dplyr_mutate.png){width=\"80%\"}\n\n\\[**Source**: [Artwork by Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)\\]\n\nFor example, with air pollution data, we often want to *detrend* the data by subtracting the mean from the data. That way we can look at whether a given day's air pollution level is higher than or less than average (as opposed to looking at its absolute level).\n\nHere we create a `pm25detrend` variable that subtracts the mean from the `pm25` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25detrend = pm25 - mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE))\nhead(chicago)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  city   tmpd dewpoint date        pm25 pm10tmean2 o3tmean2 no2tmean2 pm25detr…¹\n  <chr> <dbl>    <dbl> <date>     <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>\n1 chic     35     30.1 2005-12-31 15          23.5     2.53      13.2      -1.23\n2 chic     36     31   2005-12-30 15.1        19.2     3.03      22.8      -1.17\n3 chic     35     29.4 2005-12-29  7.45       23.5     6.79      20.0      -8.78\n4 chic     37     34.5 2005-12-28 17.8        27.5     3.26      19.3       1.52\n5 chic     40     33.6 2005-12-27 23.6        27       4.47      23.5       7.33\n6 chic     35     29.6 2005-12-26  8.4         8.5    14.0       16.8      -7.83\n# … with abbreviated variable name ¹​pm25detrend\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere is also the related `transmute()` function, which does the same thing as `mutate()` but then *drops all non-transformed variables*.\n\nHere, we de-trend the PM10 and ozone (O3) variables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(transmute(chicago, \n               pm10detrend = pm10tmean2 - mean(pm10tmean2, na.rm = TRUE),\n               o3detrend = o3tmean2 - mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  pm10detrend o3detrend\n        <dbl>     <dbl>\n1      -10.4     -16.9 \n2      -14.7     -16.4 \n3      -10.4     -12.6 \n4       -6.40    -16.2 \n5       -6.90    -15.0 \n6      -25.4      -5.39\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that there are only two columns in the transmuted data frame.\n\n### `group_by()`\n\nThe `group_by()` function is used to generate summary statistics from the data frame within strata defined by a variable. For example, in this air pollution dataset, you might want to know what the average annual level of PM2.5 is. So the stratum is the year, and that is something we can derive from the `date` variable.\n\nIn conjunction with the `group_by()` function we often use the `summarize()` function (or `summarise()` for some parts of the world).\n\nThe general operation here is a combination of splitting a data frame into separate pieces defined by a variable or group of variables (`group_by()`), and then applying a summary function across those subsets (`summarize()`).\n\nFirst, we can create a `year` variable using `as.POSIXlt()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchicago <- mutate(chicago, year = as.POSIXlt(date)$year + 1900)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can create a separate data frame that splits the original data frame by year.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nyears <- group_by(chicago, year)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we compute summary statistics for each year in the data frame with the `summarize()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(years, pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), \n          o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), \n          no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n    year  pm25    o3   no2\n   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1  1987 NaN    63.0  23.5\n 2  1988 NaN    61.7  24.5\n 3  1989 NaN    59.7  26.1\n 4  1990 NaN    52.2  22.6\n 5  1991 NaN    63.1  21.4\n 6  1992 NaN    50.8  24.8\n 7  1993 NaN    44.3  25.8\n 8  1994 NaN    52.2  28.5\n 9  1995 NaN    66.6  27.3\n10  1996 NaN    58.4  26.4\n11  1997 NaN    56.5  25.5\n12  1998  18.3  50.7  24.6\n13  1999  18.5  57.5  24.7\n14  2000  16.9  55.8  23.5\n15  2001  16.9  51.8  25.1\n16  2002  15.3  54.9  22.7\n17  2003  15.2  56.2  24.6\n18  2004  14.6  44.5  23.4\n19  2005  16.2  58.8  22.6\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`summarize()` returns a data frame with `year` as the first column, and then the annual averages of `pm25`, `o3`, and `no2`.\n\nIn a slightly more complicated example, we might want to know what are the average levels of ozone (`o3`) and nitrogen dioxide (`no2`) within quintiles of `pm25`. A slicker way to do this would be through a regression model, but we can actually do this quickly with `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n\nFirst, we can create a categorical variable of `pm25` divided into quantiles\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nqq <- quantile(chicago$pm25, seq(0, 1, 0.2), na.rm = TRUE)\nchicago <- mutate(chicago, pm25.quint = cut(pm25, qq))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can group the data frame by the `pm25.quint` variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquint <- group_by(chicago, pm25.quint)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we can compute the mean of `o3` and `no2` within quintiles of `pm25`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize(quint, o3 = mean(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), \n          no2 = mean(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  pm25.quint     o3   no2\n  <fct>       <dbl> <dbl>\n1 (1.7,8.7]    21.7  18.0\n2 (8.7,12.4]   20.4  22.1\n3 (12.4,16.7]  20.7  24.4\n4 (16.7,22.6]  19.9  27.3\n5 (22.6,61.5]  20.3  29.6\n6 <NA>         18.8  25.8\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the table, it seems there is not a strong relationship between `pm25` and `o3`, but there appears to be a positive correlation between `pm25` and `no2`. More sophisticated statistical modeling can help to provide precise answers to these questions, but a simple application of `dplyr` functions can often get you most of the way there.\n\n### `%>%`\n\nThe pipeline operator `%>%` is very handy for stringing together multiple `dplyr` functions in a sequence of operations. Notice above that every time we wanted to apply more than one function, the sequence gets buried in a sequence of nested function calls that is difficult to read, i.e.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nthird(second(first(x)))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis nesting is not a natural way to think about a sequence of operations.

Once you travel down the pipeline with `%>%`, the first argument is taken to be the output of the previous element in the pipeline.\n\nAnother example might be computing the average pollutant level by month. This could be useful to see if there are any seasonal trends in the data.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmutate(chicago, month = as.POSIXlt(date)$mon + 1) %>% \n        group_by(month) %>% \n        summarize(pm25 = mean(pm25, na.rm = TRUE), \n                  o3 = max(o3tmean2, na.rm = TRUE), \n                  no2 = median(no2tmean2, na.rm = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 12 × 4\n   month  pm25    o3   no2\n   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1     1  17.8  28.2  25.4\n 2     2  20.4  37.4  26.8\n 3     3  17.4  39.0  26.8\n 4     4  13.9  47.9  25.0\n 5     5  14.1  52.8  24.2\n 6     6  15.9  66.6  25.0\n 7     7  16.6  59.5  22.4\n 8     8  16.9  54.0  23.0\n 9     9  15.9  57.5  24.5\n10    10  14.2  47.1  24.2\n11    11  15.2  29.5  23.6\n12    12  17.5  27.7  24.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, we can see that `o3` tends to be low in the winter months and high in the summer while `no2` is higher in the winter and lower in the summer.\n\n### `slice_*()`\n\nThe `slice_sample()` function of the `dplyr` package will allow you to see a sample of random rows in random order. The number of rows to show is specified by the `n` argument. This can be useful if you don't want to print the entire tibble, but you want to get a greater sense of the values. This is a good option for data analysis reports, where printing the entire tibble would not be appropriate if the tibble is quite large.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nslice_sample(chicago, n = 10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 11\n   city   tmpd dewpoint date        pm25 pm10tme…¹ o3tme…² no2tm…³ pm25d…⁴  year\n   <chr> <dbl>    <dbl> <date>     <dbl>     <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl> <dbl>\n 1 chic   39       15.8 2002-03-23  12.1      39     26.8     17.9   -4.13  2002\n 2 chic   21       10.8 2002-02-27   9.2      26     18.3     23.7   -7.03  2002\n 3 chic   45       32.6 2000-03-14  26.1      45.5   14.0     25.3    9.87  2000\n 4 chic   76       66.2 1999-06-26  24.9      37.5   35.6     27.1    8.67  1999\n 5 chic   67       46.1 2001-05-09  10.7      59     36.9     29.3   -5.53  2001\n 6 chic   44       29.5 1992-04-28  NA        55     18.1     41.6   NA     1992\n 7 chic   67       59.9 2003-09-02  12.5      21     31.8     21.9   -3.73  2003\n 8 chic   30       21.8 2004-12-03  21        28      6.92    27.3    4.77  2004\n 9 chic   81.5     68.8 1991-09-15  NA        34.3   22.2     16.9   NA     1991\n10 chic   58       34.6 1988-10-10  NA        39     20.8     17.3   NA     1988\n# … with 1 more variable: pm25.quint <fct>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​pm10tmean2, ²​o3tmean2, ³​no2tmean2, ⁴​pm25detrend\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can also use `slice_head()` or `slice_tail()` to take a look at the top rows or bottom rows of your tibble.

With these functions we can do a number of complex operations in just a few lines of code. In particular, we can often conduct the beginnings of an exploratory analysis with the powerful combination of `group_by()` and `summarize()`.\n\nOnce you learn the `dplyr` grammar there are a few additional benefits\n\n-   `dplyr` can work with other data frame \"back ends\" such as SQL databases. There is an SQL interface for relational databases via the DBI package\n\n-   `dplyr` can be integrated with the `data.table` package for large fast tables\n\nThe `dplyr` package is handy way to both simplify and speed up your data frame management code. It is rare that you get such a combination at the same time!\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  How can you tell if an object is a tibble?\n2.  What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?\n3.  Using the `trees` dataset in base R (this dataset stores the girth, height, and volume for Black Cherry Trees) and using the pipe operator: (i) convert the `data.frame` to a tibble, (ii) filter for rows with a tree height of greater than 70, and (iii) order rows by `Volume` (smallest to largest).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(trees)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Girth Height Volume\n1   8.3     70   10.3\n2   8.6     65   10.3\n3   8.8     63   10.2\n4  10.5     72   16.4\n5  10.7     81   18.8\n6  10.8     83   19.7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n-   <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html>\n-   <https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/wrangle-data.html#data-wrangling>\n-   [dplyr cheat sheet from RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)\n:::\n\n",
