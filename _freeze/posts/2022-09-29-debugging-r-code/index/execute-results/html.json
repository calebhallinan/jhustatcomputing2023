Below I outline a four step process that I have found useful:\n\n### Google!\n\nWhenever you see an error message, **start by googling it**. \n\nIf you are lucky, you will discover that it’s a common error with a known solution.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Pro-tip\n\nWhen googling, improve your chances of a good match by removing any variable names or values that are specific to your problem.\n\n:::\n\n### Make it repeatable\n\nTo find the root cause of an error, you are going to need to execute the code many times as you consider and reject hypotheses. \n\n**To make that iteration as quick possible**, it’s worth some upfront investment to** make the problem both easy and fast to reproduce**.\n\nStart by creating a **rep**roducible **ex**ample (reprex). This will help others help you, and often leads to a solution without asking others, because in the course of making the problem reproducible you often figure out the root cause. Next, make the example minimal by removing code and simplifying data. As you do this, you may discover inputs that do not trigger the error. Make note of them: they will be helpful when diagnosing the root cause.\n\n### Figure out where it is\n\nIt’s a great idea to adopt the scientific method here. Generate hypotheses, design experiments to test them, and record your results. This may seem like a lot of work, but a systematic approach will end up saving you time. Often a lot of time can be wasted relying on my intuition to solve a bug (“oh, it must be an off-by-one error, so I’ll just subtract 1 here”), when I would have been better off taking a systematic approach.\n\nIf this fails, you might need to ask help from someone else. If you have followed the previous step, you will have a small example that is easy to share with others. That makes it much easier for other people to look at the problem, and more likely to help you find a solution.\n\n### Fix it and test it\n\nOnce you have found the bug, you need to figure out how to fix it and to check that the fix actually worked. Again, it is very useful to have automated tests in place. Not only does this help to ensure that you have actually fixed the bug, it also helps to ensure you have not introduced any new bugs in the process. In the absence of automated tests, make sure to carefully record the correct output, and check against the inputs that previously failed.\n\n\n## Something’s Wrong!\n\nOnce you have made the error repeatable, the next step is to figure out where it comes from.\n\nR has a number of ways to indicate to you that something is not right. There are different levels of indication that can be used, ranging from mere notification to fatal error. Executing any function in R may result in the following **conditions**.\n\n- `message`: A generic notification/diagnostic message produced by the `message()` function; execution of the function continues\n- `warning`: An indication that something is wrong but not necessarily fatal; execution of the function continues. Warnings are generated by the `warning()` function\n- `error`: An indication that a fatal problem has occurred and execution of the function stops. Errors are produced by the `stop()` function.\n- `condition`: A generic concept for indicating that something unexpected has occurred; programmers can create their own custom conditions if they want.\n\nHere is an example of a warning that you might receive in the course of using R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlog(-1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in log(-1): NaNs produced\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] NaN\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis warning lets you know that taking the log of a negative number results in a `NaN` value because you can't take the log of negative numbers. Nevertheless, R doesn't give an error, because it has a useful value that it can return, the `NaN` value. The warning is just there to let you know that something unexpected happen. Depending on what you are programming, you may have intentionally taken the log of a negative number in order to move on to another section of code.\n\nHere is another function that is designed to print a message to the console depending on the nature of its input.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage <- function(x) {\n        if(x > 0)\n                print(\"x is greater than zero\")\n        else\n                print(\"x is less than or equal to zero\")\n        invisible(x)        \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis function is simple---it prints a message telling you whether `x` is greater than zero or less than or equal to zero. It also returns its input **invisibly**, which is a common practice with \"print\" functions. Returning an object invisibly means that the return value does not get auto-printed when the function is called.\n\nTake a hard look at the function above and see if you can identify any bugs or problems.\n\nWe can execute the function as follows.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage(1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"x is greater than zero\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function seems to work fine at this point. No errors, warnings, or messages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage(NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in if (x > 0) print(\"x is greater than zero\") else print(\"x is less than or equal to zero\"): missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWell, the first thing the function does is test if `x > 0`. But you can't do that test if `x` is a `NA` or `NaN` value. R doesn't know what to do in this case so it stops with a fatal error.\n\nWe can fix this problem by anticipating the possibility of `NA` values and checking to see if the input is `NA` with the `is.na()` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage2 <- function(x) {\n        if(is.na(x))\n                print(\"x is a missing value!\")\n        else if(x > 0)\n                print(\"x is greater than zero\")\n        else\n                print(\"x is less than or equal to zero\")\n        invisible(x)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can run the following.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage2(NA)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"x is a missing value!\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd all is fine.\n\nNow what about the following situation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- log(c(-1, 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning in log(c(-1, 2)): NaNs produced\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage2(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in if (is.na(x)) print(\"x is a missing value!\") else if (x > 0) print(\"x is greater than zero\") else print(\"x is less than or equal to zero\"): the condition has length > 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow what?? Why are we getting this warning? The warning says \"the condition has length > 1 and only the first element will be used\". \n\nThe problem here is that I passed `printmessage2()` a vector `x` that was of length 2 rather then length 1. Inside the body of `printmessage2()` the expression `is.na(x)` returns a vector that is tested in the `if` statement. However, `if` cannot take vector arguments so you get a warning. The fundamental problem here is that `printmessage2()` is not *vectorized*.\n\nWe can solve this problem two ways. One is by simply not allowing vector arguments. The other way is to vectorize the `printmessage2()` function to allow it to take vector arguments.\n\nFor the first way, we simply need to check the length of the input.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage3 <- function(x) {\n        if(length(x) > 1L)\n                stop(\"'x' has length > 1\")\n        if(is.na(x))\n                print(\"x is a missing value!\")\n        else if(x > 0)\n                print(\"x is greater than zero\")\n        else\n                print(\"x is less than or equal to zero\")\n        invisible(x)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow when we pass `printmessage3()` a vector we should get an error.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage3(1:2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in printmessage3(1:2): 'x' has length > 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nVectorizing the function can be accomplished easily with the `Vectorize()` function.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprintmessage4 <- Vectorize(printmessage2)\nout <- printmessage4(c(-1, 2))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"x is less than or equal to zero\"\n[1] \"x is greater than zero\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can see now that the correct messages are printed without any warning or error. Note that I stored the return value of `printmessage4()` in a separate R object called `out`. This is because when I use the `Vectorize()` function it no longer preserves the invisibility of the return value.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Helpful tips\n\nThe primary task of debugging any R code is correctly diagnosing what the problem is. When diagnosing a problem with your code (or somebody else's), it's important first understand what you were expecting to occur. Then you need to idenfity what *did* occur and how did it deviate from your expectations. Some basic questions you need to ask are\n\n- What was your input? How did you call the function?\n- What were you expecting? Output, messages, other results? \n- What did you get?\n- How does what you get differ from what you were expecting? \n- Were your expectations correct in the first place?\n- Can you reproduce the problem (exactly)?\n\nBeing able to answer these questions is important not just for your own sake, but in situations where you may need to ask someone else for help with debugging the problem. Seasoned programmers will be asking you these exact questions.\n\n:::\n\n# Debugging Tools in R\n\nR provides a number of tools to help you with debugging your code. The primary tools for debugging functions in R are\n\n- `traceback()`: prints out the function call stack after an error occurs; does nothing if there’s no error\n- `debug()`: flags a function for “debug” mode which allows you to step through execution of a function one line at a time\n- `browser()`: suspends the execution of a function wherever it is called and puts the function in debug mode\n- `trace()`: allows you to insert debugging code into a function at specific places \n- `recover()`: allows you to modify the error behavior so that you can browse the function call stack\n\nThese functions are interactive tools specifically designed to allow you to pick through a function. There is also the more blunt technique of inserting `print()` or `cat()` statements in the function.\n\n## Using `traceback()`\n\nThe `traceback()` function prints out the *function call stack* after an error has occurred. The function call stack is the sequence of functions that was called before the error occurred. \n\nFor example, you may have a function `a()` which subsequently calls function `b()` which calls `c()` and then `d()`. If an error occurs, it may not be immediately clear in which function the error occurred. The `traceback()` function shows you how many levels deep you were when the error occurred.\n\n```r\n> mean(x)\nError in mean(x) : object 'x' not found\n> traceback()\n1: mean(x)\n```\nHere, it's clear that the error occurred inside the `mean()` function because the object `x` does not exist. \n\nThe `traceback()` function must be called immediately after an error occurs. Once another function is called, you lose the traceback.\n\n\nHere is a slightly more complicated example using the `lm()` function for linear modeling.\n\n```r\n> lm(y ~ x)\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos) : object ’y’ not found\n> traceback()\n7: eval(expr, envir, enclos)\n6: eval(predvars, data, env)\n5: model.frame.default(formula = y ~ x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)\n4: model.frame(formula = y ~ x, drop.unused.levels = TRUE)\n3: eval(expr, envir, enclos)\n2: eval(mf, parent.frame())\n1: lm(y ~ x)\n```\n\nYou can see now that the error did not get thrown until the 7th level of the function call stack, in which case the `eval()` function tried to evaluate the formula `y ~ x` and realized the object `y` did not exist.\n\nLooking at the traceback is useful for figuring out roughly where an error occurred but it's not useful for more detailed debugging. For that you might turn to the `debug()` function.\n\n## Using `debug()`\n\n<details> <summary> Click here for how to use `debug()` with an interactive browser.</summary>\n\nThe `debug()` function initiates an interactive debugger (also known as the \"browser\" in R) for a function. With the debugger, you can step through an R function one expression at a time to pinpoint exactly where an error occurs.\n\nThe `debug()` function takes a function as its first argument. Here is an example of debugging the `lm()` function. \n\n```r\n> debug(lm)      ## Flag the 'lm()' function for interactive debugging\n> lm(y ~ x)\ndebugging in: lm(y ~ x)\ndebug: {\n    ret.x <- x\n    ret.y <- y\n    cl <- match.call()\n    ...\n    if (!qr)\n        z$qr <- NULL \n    z\n} \nBrowse[2]>\n```\n\nNow, every time you call the `lm()` function it will launch the interactive debugger. To turn this behavior off you need to call the `undebug()` function.\n\nThe debugger calls the browser at the very top level of the function body. From there you can step through each expression in the body. There are a few special commands you can call in the browser:\n\n* `n` executes the current expression and moves to the next expression\n* `c` continues execution of the function and does not stop until either an error or the function exits\n* `Q` quits the browser\n\nHere's an example of a browser session with the `lm()` function.\n\n```r\nBrowse[2]> n   ## Evalute this expression and move to the next one\ndebug: ret.x <- x\nBrowse[2]> n\ndebug: ret.y <- y\nBrowse[2]> n\ndebug: cl <- match.call()\nBrowse[2]> n\ndebug: mf <- match.call(expand.dots = FALSE)\nBrowse[2]> n\ndebug: m <- match(c(\"formula\", \"data\", \"subset\", \"weights\", \"na.action\",\n    \"offset\"), names(mf), 0L)\n```\n\nWhile you are in the browser you can execute any other R function that might be available to you in a regular session. In particular, you can use `ls()` to see what is in your current environment (the function environment) and `print()` to print out the values of R objects in the function environment.\n\nYou can turn off interactive debugging with the `undebug()` function.\n\n```r\nundebug(lm)    ## Unflag the 'lm()' function for debugging\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n## Using `recover()`\n\n<details> <summary> Click here for how to use `recover()` with an interactive browser.</summary>\n\nThe `recover()` function can be used to modify the error behavior of R when an error occurs. Normally, when an error occurs in a function, R will print out an error message, exit out of the function, and return you to your workspace to await further commands. \n\nWith `recover()` you can tell R that when an error occurs, it should halt execution at the exact point at which the error occurred. That can give you the opportunity to poke around in the environment in which the error occurred. This can be useful to see if there are any R objects or data that have been corrupted or mistakenly modified.\n\n```r\n> options(error = recover)    ## Change default R error behavior\n> read.csv(\"nosuchfile\")      ## This code doesn't work\nError in file(file, \"rt\") : cannot open the connection\nIn addition: Warning message:\nIn file(file, \"rt\") :\n  cannot open file ’nosuchfile’: No such file or directory\n  \nEnter a frame number, or 0 to exit\n\n1: read.csv(\"nosuchfile\")\n2: read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote, dec =\n3: file(file, \"rt\")\n\nSelection:\n```\n\nThe `recover()` function will first print out the function call stack when an error occurrs. Then, you can choose to jump around the call stack and investigate the problem. When you choose a frame number, you will be put in the browser (just like the interactive debugger triggered with `debug()`) and will have the ability to poke around.\n\n</details>\n\n# Summary\n\n\n- There are three main indications of a problem/condition: `message`, `warning`, `error`; only an `error` is fatal\n- When analyzing a function with a problem, make sure you can reproduce the problem, clearly state your expectations and how the output differs from your expectation\n- Interactive debugging tools `traceback`, `debug`, `recover`, `browser`, and `trace` can be used to find problematic code in functions\n- Debugging tools are not a substitute for thinking!\n\n\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.
