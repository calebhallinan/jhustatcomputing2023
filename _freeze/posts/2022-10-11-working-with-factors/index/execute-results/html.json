What if the original data source for where the categorical data is getting ingested changes? \n    - If a domain expert is providing spreadsheet data at regular intervals, code that worked on the initial data may not generate an error message, but could silently produce incorrect results.\n2. What if a new level of a categorical data is added in an updated dataset? \n3. When categorical data are coded with numerical values, it can be easy to break the relationship between category numbers and category labels without realizing it, thus losing the information encoded in a variable. \n    - Let's consider an example of this below. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a set of decades,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nx1_original <- c(10, 10, 10, 50, 60, 20, 20, 40)\nx1_factor <- factor(x1_original)\nattributes(x1_factor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$levels\n[1] \"10\" \"20\" \"40\" \"50\" \"60\"\n\n$class\n[1] \"factor\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(x1_original, x1_factor) %>% \n  mutate(x1_numeric = as.numeric(x1_factor))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  x1_original x1_factor x1_numeric\n        <dbl> <fct>          <dbl>\n1          10 10                 1\n2          10 10                 1\n3          10 10                 1\n4          50 50                 4\n5          60 60                 5\n6          20 20                 2\n7          20 20                 2\n8          40 40                 3\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nInstead of creating a new variable with a numeric version of the value of the factor variable `x1_factor`, the **variable loses the original numerical categories** and **creates a factor number** (i.e., 10 is mapped to 1, 20 is mapped to 2, and 40 is mapped to 3, etc). \n\n:::\n\nThis **result is unexpected** because `base::as.numeric()` is intended to recover numeric information by coercing a character variable.\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Example\n\nCompare the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(c(\"hello\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: NAs introduced by coercion\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] NA\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(factor(c(\"hello\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the first example, R does not how to convert the character string to a numeric, so it returns a `NA`.\n\nIn the second example, it creates factor numbers and orders them according to an alphabetical order. Here is another example of this behavior: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nas.numeric(factor(c(\"hello\", \"goodbye\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThis behavior of the `factor()` function feels unexpected at best. \n\nAnother example of **unexpected behavior** is how the function will **silently make a missing value** because the values in the data and the levels do not match.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfactor(\"a\", levels=\"c\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] <NA>\nLevels: c\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe **unfortunate behavior of factors in R** has led to an online movement against the default behavior of many data import functions to make factors out of any variable composed as strings. \n\nThe tidyverse is part of this movement, with functions from the `readr` package defaulting to leaving strings as-is. (Others have chosen\nto add `options(stringAsFactors=FALSE)` into their start up commands.)\n\n## Factors when modeling data \n\nSo if factors are so troublesome, what's the point of them in the first place? \n\nFactors are **still necessary for some data analytic tasks**. The most salient\ncase is in **statistical modeling**.\n\nWhen you pass a factor variable into `lm()` or `glm()`, R automatically creates indicator (or more colloquially ‘dummy’) variables for each of the levels and picks one as a reference group.\n\nFor simple cases, this behavior can also be achieved with a character vector. However, to choose which level to use as a reference level or to order classes, factors must be used. \n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n\n### Example\n\nConsider a vector of character strings with three income levels: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincome_level <- c(rep(\"low\",10), \n                  rep(\"medium\",10), \n                  rep(\"high\",10))\nincome_level\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"    \"low\"   \n [9] \"low\"    \"low\"    \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\"\n[17] \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"medium\" \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"  \n[25] \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"   \"high\"  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, it **might make sense to use the lowest income level (low) as the reference** class so that all the other coefficients can be interpreted in comparison to it. \n\nHowever, R would use **high as the reference** by default because ‘h’ comes before ‘l’ in the alphabet.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- factor(income_level)\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low    low   \n[11] medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium medium\n[21] high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high   high  \nLevels: high low medium\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- rnorm(30) # generate some random obs from a normal dist\nlm(y ~ x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = y ~ x)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)         xlow      xmedium  \n    0.10975     -0.54981      0.07938  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Memory req for factors and character strings\n\nConsider a large character string such as `income_level` corresponding to a categorical variable. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nincome_level <- c(rep(\"low\",10000), \n                  rep(\"medium\",10000), \n                  rep(\"high\",10000))\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn early versions of R, storing categorical data as a factor variable was considerably more efficient than storing the same data as strings, because factor variables only store the factor labels once. \n\nHowever, R now uses a global string pool, so each unique string is only stored once, which means storage is now less of an issue. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nformat(object.size(income_level), units=\"Kb\") # size of the character string\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"234.6 Kb\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nformat(object.size(factor(income_level)), units=\"Kb\") # size of the factor\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"117.8 Kb\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Summary\n\nFactors can be really useful in many data analytic tasks, but the base R functions to work with factors can lead to some unexpected behavior that can catch new R users. \n\nLet's introduce a package to make wrangling factors easier. \n\n# `forcats`\n\nNext, we will introduce the `forcats` package, which is part of the core `tidyverse`, but can also be loaded directly\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(forcats)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIt provides tools for dealing with **cat**egorical variables (and it's an anagram of factors!) using a wide range of helpers for working with factors.\n\n## General Social Survey\n\nFor the rest of this lecture, we are going to use the `gss_cat` dataset that is installed when you load `forcats`.\n\nIt's a sample of data from the [General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org), a long-running US survey conducted by the independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe **survey has thousands of questions**, so in `gss_cat`. \n\nI have selected a handful that will illustrate some common challenges you will encounter when working with factors.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 21,483 × 9\n    year marital         age race  rincome        partyid    relig denom tvhours\n   <int> <fct>         <int> <fct> <fct>          <fct>      <fct> <fct>   <int>\n 1  2000 Never married    26 White $8000 to 9999  Ind,near … Prot… Sout…      12\n 2  2000 Divorced         48 White $8000 to 9999  Not str r… Prot… Bapt…      NA\n 3  2000 Widowed          67 White Not applicable Independe… Prot… No d…       2\n 4  2000 Never married    39 White Not applicable Ind,near … Orth… Not …       4\n 5  2000 Divorced         25 White Not applicable Not str d… None  Not …       1\n 6  2000 Married          25 White $20000 -

Generally there is a positive association between income and age, and the income band with the highest average age is \"Not applicable\".' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhy do you think the average age for \"Not applicable\" is so high?\n\nAnother type of reordering is useful when you are coloring the lines on a plot.\n`fct_reorder2(f, x, y)` reorders the factor `f` by the `y` values associated with the largest `x` values.\n\nThis makes the plot easier to read because the colors of the line at the far right of the plot will line up with the legend.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nby_age <- \n  gss_cat %>% \n  filter(!is.na(age)) %>% \n  count(age, marital) %>% \n  group_by(age) %>% \n  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))\n\nby_age %>% \n  ggplot(aes(age, prop, colour = marital)) +\n    geom_line(na.rm = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){fig-alt='A line plot with age on the x-axis and proportion on the y-axis.

width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, for bar plots, you can use `fct_infreq()` to order levels in decreasing frequency: this is the simplest type of reordering because it doesn't need any extra variables.\nCombine it with `fct_rev()` if you want them in increasing frequency so that in the bar plot largest values are on the right, not the left.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat

values.\nThis allows you to clarify labels for publication, and collapse levels for high-level displays.\n\nThe most general and powerful tool is `fct_recode()`.\nIt allows you to recode, or change, the value of each level.\nFor example, take the `gss_cat$partyid`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  count(partyid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   partyid                n\n   <fct>              <int>\n 1 No answer            154\n 2 Don't know             1\n 3 Other party          393\n 4 Strong republican   2314\n 5 Not str

terse and inconsistent.\nLet's tweak them to be longer and use a parallel construction.\nLike most rename and recoding functions in the tidyverse, the new values go on the left and the old values go on the right:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,\n      \"Republican, strong\"    = \"Strong republican\",\n      \"Republican, weak\"      = \"Not str republican\",\n      \"Independent, near rep\" = \"Ind,near rep\",\n      \"Independent, near dem\" = \"Ind,near dem\",\n      \"Democrat, weak\"        = \"Not str democrat\",\n      \"Democrat, strong\"      = \"Strong democrat\")) %>% \n  count(partyid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   partyid                   n\n   <fct>

aren't explicitly mentioned as is, and will warn you if you accidentally refer to a level that doesn't exist.\n\nTo combine groups, you can assign multiple old levels to the same new level:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  mutate(partyid = fct_recode(partyid,\n      \"Republican, strong\"    = \"Strong republican\",\n      \"Republican, weak\"      = \"Not str

3490\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nUse this technique with care: if you group together categories that are truly different you will end up with misleading results.\n\nIf you want to collapse a lot of levels, `fct_collapse()` is a useful variant of `fct_recode()`.\nFor each new variable, you can provide a vector of old levels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  mutate(partyid = fct_collapse(partyid,\n      \"other\" = c(\"No answer\", \"Don't know\", \"Other party\"),\n      \"rep\" = c(\"Strong republican\", \"Not str republican\"),\n      \"ind\" = c(\"Ind,near rep\", \"Independent\", \"Ind,near dem\"),\n      \"dem\" = c(\"Not str democrat\", \"Strong democrat\"))) %>% \n  count(partyid)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  partyid     n\n  <fct>   <int>\n1 other     548\n2 rep      5346\n3 ind      8409\n4 dem      7180\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSometimes you just want to lump together the small groups to make a plot or table simpler.\n\nThat's the job of the `fct_lump_*()` family of functions.\n`fct_lump_lowfreq()` is a simple starting point that progressively lumps the smallest groups categories into \"Other\", always keeping \"Other\" as the smallest category.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  mutate(relig = fct_lump_lowfreq(relig)) %>% \n  count(relig)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  relig          n\n  <fct>      <int>\n1 Protestant 10846\n2 Other      10637\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case it's not very helpful: it is true that the majority of Americans in this survey are Protestant, but we'd probably like to see some more details!\nInstead, we can use the `fct_lump_n()` to specify that we want exactly 10 groups:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngss_cat %>% \n  mutate(relig = fct_lump_n(relig, n = 10)) %>% \n  count(relig, sort = TRUE) %>% \n  print(n = Inf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   relig                       n\n   <fct>                   <int>\n 1 Protestant              10846\n 2 Catholic                 5124\n 3 None                     3523\n 4 Christian

Orthodox-christian         95\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRead the documentation to learn about `fct_lump_min()` and `fct_lump_prop()` which are useful in other cases.\n\n## Ordered factors\n\nBefore we go on, there's a special type of factor that needs to be mentioned briefly: ordered factors.\nOrdered factors, created with `ordered()`, imply a strict ordering and equal distance between levels: the first level is \"less than\" the second level by the same amount that the second level is \"less than\" the third level, and so on..\nYou can recognize them when printing because they use `<` between the factor levels:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nordered(c(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] a b c\nLevels: a < b < c\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn practice, `ordered()` factors behave very similarly to regular factors.\nThere are only two places where you might notice different behavior:\n\n-   If you map an ordered factor to color or fill in ggplot2, it will default to `scale_color_viridis()`/`scale_fill_viridis()`, a color scale that implies a ranking.\n-   If you use an ordered function in a linear model, it will use \"polygonal contrasts\". These are mildly useful, but you are unlikely to have heard of them unless you have a PhD in Statistics, and even then you probably don't routinely interpret them. If you want to learn more, we recommend `vignette(\"contrasts\", package = \"faux\")` by Lisa DeBruine.\n\nGiven the arguable utility of these differences, we don't generally recommend using ordered factors.\n\n# Post-lecture materials\n\n### Final Questions\n\nHere are some post-lecture questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  Explore the distribution of `rincome` (reported income).\n    What makes the default bar chart hard to understand?\n    How could you improve the plot?\n\n2.  What is the most common `relig` in this survey?\n    What's the most common `partyid`?\n\n3.  Which `relig` does `denom` (denomination) apply to?\n    How can you find out with a table?\n    How can you find out with a visualization?\n    \n4.  There are some suspiciously high numbers in `tvhours`.\n    Is the mean a good summary?\n\n5.  For each factor in `gss_cat` identify whether the order of the levels is arbitrary or principled.\n\n6.  Why did moving \"Not applicable\" to the front of the levels move it to the bottom of the plot?\n\n7.  How have the proportions of people identifying as Democrat, Republican, and Independent changed over time?\n\n8.  How could you collapse `rincome` into a small set of categories?\n\n9.  Notice there are 9 groups (excluding other) in the `fct_lump` example above.\n    Why not 10?\n    (Hint: type `?fct_lump`, and find the default for the argument `other_level` is \"Other\".)\n\n\n:::\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n::: callout-tip\n\n- <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors>\n- [Wrangling Categorical Data in R](https://peerj.com/preprints/3163) by Amelia McNamara, Nicholas J Horton\n- <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/12-supp-factors>\n- <https://forcats.tidyverse.org>\n\n:::\n\n",
